It was later republished in the book Big Computer Games (Creative Computing Press, 1984)

ROLLERCOASTER-ORIGINAL is the code typed from the book. Tested but
probably contains typos and defintiely contains a few bugs. This version can be used with an
Omniscan videodisc interface by Aurora Systems along with a Pioneer VP-1000 laserdisc player,
using the DiscoVision version of the Rollercoaster movie.

ROLLERCOASTER-2018 includes updates by Kay Savetz. Modified to work with a Pioneer LD-V2200 or
compatable laserdisc player. Fixed bugs, added a title screen, but true to the original.

ROLLERCOASTER-DVD. Modified to work with a Pioneer DVD-V8000 DVD player. Made a few small changes that
pleased me.

VIDEODISC_ADVENTURE_-_DISK_1__SIDE_A.woz and related files. Learned months later that Creative Computing also published the adventure on disk, including cool intro screens not present in the type-in magazine version. May contain other differences, too, who knows! Thanks to the National Videogame Museum for the disk images!
